# About


### Mission
* To support collaborative, reproducible and efficient data science in the SRM research community
* To equip researchers with computational resources in the cloud

This jupyter book is written to accompany a cloud hub - the [ReflectiveCloud](https://reflective.2i2c.cloud/) which is a Jupyter notebook server providing free compute power in a pangeo python environment on cloud computing resources, available to the SRM research community.
