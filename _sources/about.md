## Mission

Our mission is twofold:

- **To support collaborative, reproducible and efficient data science** in the SRM research community
- **To equip researchers with computational resources** in the cloud

---

## Platform Overview

This Jupyter Book accompanies **[ReflectiveCloud](https://reflective.2i2c.cloud/)** - a powerful Jupyter notebook server providing **free compute power** in a Pangeo Python environment on cloud computing resources, available to the SRM research community.

```{admonition} Access to Platform
