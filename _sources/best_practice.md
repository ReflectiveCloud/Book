# Best Practices


***

Close out your browser tab every time that you log out. This keeps each log in clean and can prevent weird artifacts from popping up on your next log in.

To save money for us, when you finish on the Hub
* Go to `File` > `Hub Control Panel` > push `Stop Server`
* Once that button disappears, your server has stopped
* Click `Log Out`
* Close that browser tab before starting CryoCloud again to prevent errors --> You may receive an error if you try to restart CryoCloud from this same tab

<font color="red">The hub will automatically shut off after 90 minute of no active use or by the user logging off</font>

Please keep saved files in your home directory to a minimum. Let us know if you need to store more than around 10GB.
