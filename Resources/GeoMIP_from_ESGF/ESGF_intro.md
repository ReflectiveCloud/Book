# GeoMIP Analysis Using ESGF

---

## Overview

This section contains **two Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating examples of working directly with data on the ESGF nodes, downloading data on-the-fly directly in the notebook. These examples utilize the powerful **[intake-esgf](https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)** Python package for seamless data access.

## Notebook Location

The notebooks shown in the next two pages are also stored under `/shared/Code_examples` for easy access.

## Available Notebooks

### **1. Data Access Example**

**[search_and_load_from_esgf.ipynb](search_and_load_from_esgf.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to read in data using the **intake-esgf package**.

**What you'll learn:**

- Searching for GeoMIP data on ESGF nodes
- Using intake-esgf for data discovery
- Downloading and loading data directly in notebooks
- Basic data access workflows

### **2. Analysis Example**

**[G6sulfur_from_ESGF_example.ipynb](G6sulfur_from_ESGF_example.ipynb)**

This notebook shows a practical example of using the intake-esgf workflow to **plot and analyze GeoMIP data**.

**What you'll learn:**

- Applying the intake-esgf workflow to real analysis
- Working with G6sulfur GeoMIP simulations
- Creating visualizations from ESGF data
- End-to-end analysis workflows
