# GeoMIP analysis using ESGF

This section contains two Jupyter notebooks showing examples of working directly with data on the ESGF nodes, downloading on the fly directly in the notebook. They make use of the python package [intake-esgf](https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). 
***
The notebooks shown in the next two pages are also stared under `/shared/Code_examples`


* search_and_load_from_esgf.ipynb : this notebook shows how to read in data using the intake-esgf package. 

* G6sulfur_from_ESGF_example.ipynb : this notebook shows an example of using this workflow to plot GeoMIP data.
